Bevolv ios Test Summary

Acknowledgment

I acknowledge that my proficiency in Swift and iOS development is limited, and I heavily relied on online resources and tutorials to complete this task.

Covered Features

* REST API Integration: Connected to the Chronicling America API to retrieve publication data related to Oakland.

* Two Screens: Implemented two screens - the first screen displays a list of publications, and the second screen shows detailed information about a selected publication.

* Publication Details: Provided detailed information about each publication, including title and publisher.

* Image Integration: Utilized the Picsum API to fetch sample images for publications. In case of failure to load a sample image, a placeholder image is displayed, enhancing the visual appeal of the application.

Not Covered

* Pagination: Although the API supports pagination, it was not implemented in the application.
